# Golden-Phase Prime-Shift Operators  
### Gauge-Twisted Arithmetic Dynamics

## Overview

This document introduces **gauge-twisted prime-shift operators**, using golden-ratio–
based phases as **spectral probes** of arithmetic coherence.

The golden phase is diagnostic, not explanatory.

---

## Core Idea

- Arithmetic dynamics as a graph n ↔ pn
- U(1) gauge phases from arithmetic potentials
- Golden ratio as maximally non-resonant probe
- Phase sensitivity as a test of hidden coherence

---

## What This Paper Explores

- Gauge-covariant prime-shift operators
- Formal symmetry and domain issues
- Spectral interference under phase twisting
- Numerical falsifiability protocols

---

## What It Does NOT Claim

- No explanation of prime distribution
- No enforcement of RH
- No numerological assertions

---

## Status

**Exploratory / falsifiable operator probe.**

---

## Relation to Other Documents

- Gauge refinement of SMRK operators
- Compatible with QFM and Quansistor fields

---

## Intended Audience

- Operator theorists
- Spectral experimenters
- Researchers exploring arithmetic dynamics
